Description
===========
Develop a native Android app that allows for salesforce.com administrative functions to be handled remotely. An admin&#39;s job is never ends so being able to do some common admin features from the road would greatly simplify an admin&#39;s life. This is not an all encompassing administration application. This competition came from the great idea <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/appirio.com/document/d/1s0EhNK_x2ZQH5lJ1vy03ib0Ez2eBwArdBus2JDn8Hos/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CPeq7cIE#" target="_blank">submission</a> from <a href="http://www.cloudspokes.com/profile.html?username=knthornt" target="_blank">knthornt</a>.
